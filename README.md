<h2> :left_speech_bubble: About me </h2>
I am a full-stack software developer located in Orange County. What makes me excited about programming is how flexible and limitless creativity can go. I enjoy the victories after solving problems, but always welcome the challenges to learn more. My simple pleasures include going to the beach :beach_umbrella: and spending quality time with family :family_man_woman_boy_boy:!
